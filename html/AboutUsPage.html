            <p>
                Adidas was founded in 1949 by Adolf Dassler in Herzogenaurach, Germany. Over the years, we have grown
                from a small family business into one of the most recognizable names in sportswear. Our journey has been
                marked by iconic moments in sports history and collaborations with some of the worldâ€™s greatest athletes.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the first pair of football boots to the most advanced running shoes today, Adidas continues to push
                the limits of innovation and design. We are proud of our heritage and excited for what the future holds.
